This repository contains an automated system for tracking tennis matches and calculating player rankings using the Elo rating system. The entire process is managed through GitHub Issues and Actions, making it easy to use, especially on mobile devices.

## Initial Setup (For New Tennis Leagues)

If you're setting up this system for your own tennis league, follow these one-time configuration steps:

### 1. Fork/Clone This Repository

- Fork this repository to your GitHub account or organization
- Clone it locally to make the initial configuration changes

### 2. Configure Repository Settings

#### Enable GitHub Actions to Create Pull Requests

1. Go to your repository **Settings** â†’ **Actions** â†’ **General**
2. Under "Workflow permissions", select **"Read and write permissions"**
3. Check **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"**

Note: If you cloned this under an organization, you need to enable the "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" option for the organization or else the organization's setting will override the repository setting.

#### Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository **Settings** â†’ **Pages**
2. Under "Source", select **"GitHub Actions"**
3. This allows the automated workflows to deploy your leaderboard

### 3. Create Required Labels

Create these labels in your repository (**Issues** â†’ **Labels** â†’ **New label**):

- **`new-match`** - Used by the issue template to trigger match processing
- **`ranking-update`** - Applied to automated ranking update pull requests

### 4. Add Your Players

Edit the `players.yml` file to include the GitHub usernames of all players in your league:

```yaml
- alice
- bob
- charlie
- your-username
```

### 5. Reset Rankings and Match History

Clear the existing rankings by editing `ranking.csv` to contain only the header:

```csv
player,rating
```

Clear the existing match history by deleting the `matches` directory.

### 6. Update the README links to point to deployed leaderboard

Update the README links to point to the deployed leaderboard.

```markdown
[**View the Live Leaderboard**](https://your-org.github.io/your-repo/)
```

if this is not under an organization, you will use your username instead of the organization name.

```markdown
[**View the Live Leaderboard**](https://your-username.github.io/tennis)
```

## How to Record a Match

Follow these simple steps to record a match and have the rankings updated automatically.

1. **Open the Issue Form**: Go to the "Issues" tab of this repository and click on the **"ðŸŽ¾ Record a match"** button.
2. **Fill in the Details**:
    - **Match date**: The date the match was played (in YYYY-MM-DD format).
    - **Players**: The GitHub handles of the two players, separated by a comma. **The winner must be listed first.** (e.g., `@winner, @loser`)
    - **Sets**: The score of each set, one per line. The winner's score must be listed first. (e.g., `6-3`)
3. **Submit the Issue**: Click "Submit new issue".
4. **Review and Approve the PR**: A bot will create a pull request (PR) with the match data. The two players involved will be requested to review it.
5. **Merge the PR**: Once the PR is approved, it can be merged. The rankings will be automatically updated within a minute or two.

That's it! No command line, no code, just a simple form.

## Ranking System

Player rankings are calculated using the [Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system). After each match is merged, an automated workflow recalculates the ratings and creates a pull request with the updated `ranking.csv` file. Once that PR is merged, the [live leaderboard](https://stonehenge-collective.github.io/sc-tenis-league) is updated automatically.
