## How to Record a Match

Follow these simple steps to record a match and have the rankings updated automatically.

1. **Open the Issue Form**: Go to the "Issues" tab of this repository and click on the **"ðŸŽ¾ Record a match"** button.
2. **Fill in the Details**:
    - **Match date**: The date the match was played (in YYYY-MM-DD format).
    - **Players**: The GitHub handles of the two players, separated by a comma. **The winner must be listed first.** (e.g., `@winner, @loser`)
    - **Sets**: The score of each set, one per line. The winner's score must be listed first. (e.g., `6-3`)
3. **Submit the Issue**: Click "Submit new issue".
4. **Review and Approve the PR**: A bot will create a pull request (PR) with the match data. The two players involved will be requested to review it.
5. **Merge the PR**: Once the PR is approved, it can be merged. The rankings will be automatically updated within a minute or two.

That's it! No command line, no code, just a simple form.

## Ranking System

Player rankings are calculated using the [Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system). After each match is merged, an automated workflow recalculates the ratings and creates a pull request with the updated `ranking.csv` file. Once that PR is merged, the [live leaderboard](https://stonehenge-collective.github.io/sc-tenis-league) is updated automatically.
